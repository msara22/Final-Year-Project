# Final-Year-Project

In this repo, I have presented my final year project. The topic of my project is "A Smart and Efficient Methodology for Energy Consumption Prediction in Smart Homes Using Regression-Based Machine Learning Techniques!".

The main purpose of this paper is to find an efficient method for energy consumption prediction in smart homes. The proposed technique consists of five modules, namely data acquisition, data preprocessing, prediction, performance evaluation and application. For this work, the data collected is from residential smart buildings located in South Korea, Seoul. 

**Hardware and Software Specifications used in the proposed model implementations:**

            NumPy
            Pandas
            Sklearn
            
Framework:  Flask

**Machine Learning Models:**
1. Artificial Neural Networks
2. XGBoost Regression
3.Classification and Regression Tree
4.K-NN Regression
5. Random Forest Algorithm
6. Proposed (Cohesive Technique)

**Performace evaluation metrics:**
